This code is currently broken because the github auth api I started with is deprecated. I'll have to update to the new api later.

Basic authentication has been deprecated. See https://github.com/octokit/auth-basic.js/#deprecation

The new api info is at https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api
